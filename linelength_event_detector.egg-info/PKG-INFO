Description: # linelength_event_detector
        
        The `linelength_event_detector` Python package. This package contains code to:
        
        - Detect abnormal events in wave data (namely, spikes in EEG data) using line-length transform algorithm.
        - Take a matrix of data (n_elecs x n_samples) and output an array of onsets and offsets of detected spikes (n_spikes x 2) 
        and an array of the electrodes involved in each spike event (n_spikes x n_elecs), with them being labeled 1 for active, 0 for not.
        
        ## Package setup.
        ### 1. Install required packages
        
        To install the package and have a copy of the code to edit locally, navigate to where you would like to store the package code in your terminal. Clone the package  and then install:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/Kleen-Lab/linelength_event_detector.git
        pip install -e linelength_event_detector
        ```
        
        If you just want to use the package as is but still want to install it in your own Python environment, use the following command instead:
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/Kleen-Lab/linelength_event_detector.git
        ```
